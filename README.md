# Deep-Neural-Network-for-Foreign-Object-Detection-in-Chest-X-rays
In this paper, we address the use of Deep Neural Network (DNN) to detect circle-like foreign objects of difference sizes in CXRs. We present faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) for foreign object detection on a set of 400 publicly available CXR images hosted by LHNCBC, U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM), National Institutes of Health (NIH). The proposed DNN achieved 97% precision, 90% recall, and 93% F1-score. The results are comparable with the existing techniques.
